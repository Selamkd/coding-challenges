# Coding-challenges
A repository for practicing problem-solving katas, organised by month.

## About
This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills through regular practice of katas sourced from CodeWars, LeetCode, and Codurance. Each week new katas are added along with corresponding tests, and these katas are organised into monthly directories. This structured approach helps in tracking my progress and ensures consistent practice.

### Installation 
  1. Clone the repository: 

``https://github.com/Selamkd/coding-challenges.git``

### Usage
Navigate through the repository to find katas. Each kata has:

1. Solution class: contains the solution to the problem.
2. Test class:</bold> contains the tests to verify the correctness of the solution.


### Running Tests

JUnit tests are included for each kata. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Tests directory(organised by month).
2. Compile the test files.
3. Run the tests using JUnit.
