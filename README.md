# Coding-challenges
A repository for practicing problem-solving katas, organised by month.

## Description 
<p>This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills through regular practice of katas sourced from CodeWars, LeetCode, and Codurance. Each day, a new kata is added along with corresponding tests, and these katas are organised into monthly directories. This structured approach helps in tracking my progress and ensures consistent practice.</p>

### Installation 
<p>1. Clone the repository: </p>

``https://github.com/Selamkd/coding-challenges.git``
### Usage
<p>Navigate through the repository to find katas. Each kata has:</p>
<p>1.<bold>Solution class:</bold> contains the solution to the problem.</p>
<p>1.<bold>Test class:</bold> contains the tests to verify the correctness of the solution.</p>

## Running Tests

JUnit tests are included for each kata. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Tests directory(organised by month).
2. Compile the test files.
3. Run the tests using JUnit.
